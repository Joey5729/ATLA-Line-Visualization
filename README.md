Avatar: The Last Airbender was released on US Netflix on May 15, 2020. This just so happens to align with the end of finals for me, so I've decided to rewatch it and see what combinations of characters had the most lines spoken to each other and model them in a fun, interactive way.

I identified the following characters as important enough to be counted:

Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Zuko, Iroh, Suki, Azula, Ozai, Mai, and Ty Lee (Sorry to all the Boomy, Gran-Gran, and Sozin fans out there)
All disguises/aliases (Painted Lady, Blind Bandit, Blue Spirit, Lee, Mushi, Wang Fire, etc) are counted as the person they really are

For the purposes of this project, I defined a line of dialouge as a block of speech spoken by one character to another, unbroken by: the interuption of the block by another character speaking (including the person the speaker is talking to or other characters that aren't a part of this project), the speaker switching the addresse of their speaking, a scene change, or the end of an episode.

Lines spoken from a character not listed to one that is (and vice versa) are not counted.

Lines spoken during dream sequences/flashbacks/visions/episode recaps are not counted.

Notable one-off cases:

107; Winter Solstice- Part 1- The Spirit World: Aang tries the talk to Katara when he's in the spirit world, but she can't hear him. The first line was counted, since he thought he was in conversation; subsequent lines were not.

112; The Storm: Iroh's story to the Lieutenant portrays dialouge amongst himself, Zuko, and Ozai. I consider this a flashback, so the lines are not counted.

120; The Siege of the North- Part 2: Zuko directly addresses Aang's body while he is in the spirit world. I don't consider this dialouge, so I didn't count these lines.

207; Zuko Alone: This episode famously features no recurring characters but Zuko, apart from flashbacks featuring himself, Azula, Mai, Ty Lee, and Ozai. I didn't want to put an empty document through the program so I just didn't make a file for this episode.

212; The Serpent's Pass: Toph addresses Suki as if she was Sokka (you know exactly what I'm talking about); I counted this as Toph speaking to Suki.

216; Appa's Lost Days: This entire episode might be a flashback. I decided to count the lines in this episode anyway. Sue me.

219; The Guru: Katara addresses Azula as if she was Suki; I counted this as Katara speaking to Azula (and vice versa).
