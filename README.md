Avatar: The Last Airbender will be/was released on Netflix on May 15, 2020. This just so happens to align with the end of finals for me, so I've decided to rewatch it and see what combinations of characters had the most lines spoken to each other and model them in a fun, interactive way.

I identified the following characters as important enough to be counted:

Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Zuko, Iroh, Suki, Azula, Ozai, Mai, and Ty Lee (Sorry to all the Boomy, Gran-Gran, and Sozin fans out there)

For the purposes of this project, I defined a line of dialouge as a block of speech spoken by one character to another, unbroken by: the interuption of the block by another character speaking (including the person the speaker is talking to), the speaker switching the addresse of their speaking, a scene change, or a commercial break/end of episode. 

Lines spoken from a character not listed to one that is (and vice versa) are not counted.

Lines spoken during flashbacks/episode recaps are not counted.
